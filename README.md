## Base Unit Drivers: [FTDI VCP](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers)

The drivers for the USB base units are not supplied with the H-ITT CRS software.  Typically they come with the operating system or are automatically installed when the base unit is plugged in.  It is best to restart the H-ITT software after the driver gets installed.  If needed, the drivers can be manually installed from the [FTDI site](https://ftdichip.com).  [The drivers needed are the virtual com port (VCP) drivers](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/vcp-drivers)
